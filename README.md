🌈 Mood Explorer Game – Interactive Personality Experience

The Mood Explorer Game is a fun, interactive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users explore their emotional tendencies through a series of visually engaging questions.

The game presents 9 creative questions, each designed around intuitive choices such as shapes, colors, patterns, landscapes, music, weather, activities, time of day, and snacks. Instead of direct emotional questions, users make instinctive selections that subtly contribute to an internal mood score.

✨ Key Features

Animated gradient background for a lively and modern look

Custom shape buttons (circle, triangle, square, trapezium) using CSS and images

Smooth hover animations for better user interaction

Step-by-step question flow with dynamic transitions

Mood calculation system based on user selections

Final mood result displayed with emoji for a playful finish

🧠 How It Works

Each choice increases a score linked to a specific mood. After all questions are answered, the game calculates the highest-scoring mood and displays a personalized result such as Cheerful, Calm, Curious, Focused, or Playful.
